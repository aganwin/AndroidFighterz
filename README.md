This is a variation of the mobile game All-In-Fighter that I developed with my friend over 7 months. This version removed the feature of virtual 2D space and focus on the idea of vertical scrolling.


All-In-Fighter is a mobile game developed with Corona SDK that is inspired by the popular Windows beat-em-up game Little Fighter 2, as well as Super Smash Bros. and various fighting games such as Street Fighter and Jump Superstars. To prevent a bad gameplay experience, much of the initial release will feel like LF2, except with our own art and different physics.

To test for yourself, please download Corona SDK, then simply run main.lua. Encouraged to use a device such as Galaxy S3 or higher resolution.

Building to device might incur lower/uppercase errors for the files, if so, please contact me.
